O: Having experience working with different state management solutions, like Redux and Zustand. Working on a project purely with props to deliver and modify state data is extreemely complicated and confusing, making the components and application difficult to manage and debug. I rarely purely use useContext + useReducer hooks on their own to manage global states, which removes a lot of boiletplate codes libraries like Redux requires.

R: Relaxed

I: Although tools like the Chrome React Developer Tools do help with debugging and development by visualizing the states in the components and understanding bottleneck through using a profiler. To me, using useContext and useReducer on its own makes global state management quicker but lack some creature comforts that Redux/Zustand offers but at the cost of being more heavy.

D: Moving forward, I will continue to make use of global state management libraries/tools like Reducers with Context, Redux or Zustand, in order to facilitate development of frontend project with React.
