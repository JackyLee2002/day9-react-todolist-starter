O: Having experience working with different routing solutions, like React Router DOM, and UI libraries like Ant Design, they provide an easy-to-use solutions for basic react app support routing/paging and to add different Stylised UI components quickly.

R: Dislike

I: However, I personally dislike both React-Router and Ant Design for different reason.
For React-Router, its functionalities when compared to a more fully-featured solution like NextJS paging routing, a lot of features are lacking and need more boilterplate JSX codes compared to the file-structured-based paging system of Next.
For Ant Design, its documentation are really lacking in detail, meaning I have to look at the TS definitions of some of the components in order to find their meaning and correct usage. Additionally, Ant Design's components are less flexible than others like MUI when we need to add additional styling on top of whats provided.

D: Personally, I still prefer the alternatives mentioned, but having worked with both of them at work, they can still be tuned/adopted for large-scale applications in OOCL.
